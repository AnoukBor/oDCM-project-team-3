## 1.1 Motivation (needs update)

### Motivation for data context 

The housing crisis is one of the most prominent societal challenges in the Netherlands 
momentarily. Being both very competitive and inaccessible, housing prices continue to rise at 
astonishing rates as supply is very limited, with many prospective buyers having to overbid in 
order to ensure the success of their purchase. Therefore, all these factors combined make it 
very challenging for, especially first-time buyer and young professionals (only 3% of housing 
is financially accessible to them), to get their foot onto the property ladder. Our aim is to 
facilitate these groups in terms of their search for buying or renting a house, by establishing 
a dataset which allows us to clarify which places in the Netherlands are hit hardest by the 
Dutch housing crisis (where you wouldn’t want to buy or rent a house at the moment) and 
which the least. 

### Motivation for choice of website/API 

We plan to establish such dataset by scraping Huizenzoeker.nl which 
contains much information about the Dutch housing market, including many statistics about 
the housing prices and how these fluctuate and have developed in different areas over the 
last years and months.
