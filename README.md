# Scraping Huizenzoeker.nl to analyse the Dutch Housing Market 

__Which places in the Netherlands are hit hardest by the Dutch Housing crisis, and which the least?__

Momentarily, its housing crisis is one of the most prominent societal challenges in the Netherlands. The Dutch housing market is both very competitive as well as inaccessible as it must deal with a supply shortage, which in turn leads to long waiting lists for social housing. The transaction prices of houses are going through the roof, as CBS (Centraal Planbureau voor Statistiek, 2021) revealed that prices in the first quarter of 2021 were 11,3% higher compared to a year before, which is way above the average increase in Europe. Many prospective buyers have to overbid on the listings in order to ensure a place to live. However, the problem is that the amount of mortage is determined by the appraisal value of the house, which causes many to put their own capital into the purchase. This makes it very challenging for new entrants on the market (think of first-time buyers, young professionals) to succeed in renting or buying a house or appartment, especially as many are still paying off large amounts of student debt. It appears that only 3% of first-time buyers are financially able to buy a home without getting themselves into serious financial trouble. 

We have considered a few other housing sites, but Huizenzoeker.nl seemed like the best option as it offers a clear view of the Dutch housing market, with a wide range of listings and more information than the other sites we came across (both on the houses themselves, but also the neighbourhood). Other sides we considered include Funda.nl, which is the largest housing provider in the Netherlands, however the site as not the best to use for our scraping project as Funda does a good job at protecting its data to brace themselves for competitor sites. Similarly, Zoekallehuizen.nl also offers a large range of listings, but could not provide us with all information needed to research the housing crisis (it especially missed important data on overbidding). Remax.nl is also a large site which mainly focuses on houses in other countries, like Spain and Belgium. However, we were set on the idea to analyse the Dutch housing market because of this ' trend' of a supply shortage which makes the data a lot more interesting to research. 

Huizenzoeker data used is available at [Huizenzoeker.nl](https://www.huizenzoeker.nl/).

## Documentation

### 1 Motivation

#### 1.1 For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description. 

As the seriousness of the housing crisis and the shortage of listings differs across the country, we aimed to create a dataset which represented the current housing market for each municipality in every province of the Netherlands. It would clarify which places are hit hardest by the crisis and which the least. With this dataset, we may faciliate these first-time buyers and young professionals in terms of their search to buy or a rent a place by showing them where they would have the highest chances. Furthermore, it would provide them with insights on recent price developments of listings in a certain area, which helps them in negotiations about the purhcase price. Therefore, this dataset provides consumers with other data in addition to what information is offered by their broker (e.g. direct information from the Kadaster). There were already some datasets available on the Dutch housing market, however these did not specifically focus on the overbidding aspect of the current crisis which forms an essential part of our research. Besides that, instead of only focussing on certain parts of the Netherlands we preferred to focus on all municipalities in the Netherlands to get a more complete picture of the current state of the housing crisis. 

#### 1.2 Who created this dataset (e.g. which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?

Huizenzoeker.nl is an independent platform which is not influenced or moderated by estate agents, as it aims to inform its clients in a honest manner with reliable information. It is perceived as an aggregate site which collects information from public different sources, such as JAAP.nl. However, as Huizenzoeker.nl is owned by Spotzi, a big data visualizations specialist that focuses on the visualizing and analysing of spatial data, The Huizenzoeker team also provides much data themselves. From Spotzi, they retrieve much data on, for example, the value of the listings and development of housing prices. This is beneficial to our scraping project as this resulted in longs lists of information present for each listing, municipality, province etc. Therefore, it does not only provide specifics on the houses themselves like every other site, but also on the neighbourhood, the mean income in the municipality, and the distance to the closest supermarket. The platform states that it is a partner of JAAP.nl and Huislijn.nl, however it does not have explicit consent from JAAP.NL to show all information that is displayed on JAAP.nl (which seems quite contradictionary). These databanks also get their data from other sites, such as Funda.nl.  

#### 1.3 Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number. 
The dataset is funded by advertisers on the site. Advertisers can target vistors on the site through the filter options, which allows advertisers to target based on different home characteristics or on region and price range. As Spotzi created various profiles from the data they compiled, e.g. starters (young and ambitious), families with children (nest builder), kids away from home (thriving fifties); advertisers can target very specifically to a certain audience within a certain zip code. These profiles can also be used on external sites through the Rearch extension function. 

### 2 Composition

#### 2.1 What do instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g. documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of in-stances (e.g. movies, users, ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description. 

The instances that comprise the dataset represent houses, however in our dataset their data is grouped at muncipality-level. All municipalities belong to a larger type of instance, the provinces. 

#### 2.2 How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate?)

In total there are 12 provinces, each with their own municipalities: 
* Groningen = 10 municipalities
* Friesland = 18 municipalities
* Drenthe = 12 municipalities
* Overijssel = 25 municipalities
* Flevoland = 6 municipalities
* Gelderland = 51 municipalities
* Noord-Holland = 47 municipalities
* Zuid-Holland = 52 municipalities
* Utrecht = 26 municipalities
* Limburg = 31 municipalities
* Noord-Brabant = 61 municipalities
* Zeeland = 13 municipalities
Total = 352 municipalities.

#### 2.3 Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g. to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable). 

It is a sample in the sense that all listings are included but as averages of their municipality. Therefore it is certainly representative of the larger set as it covers the whole country. 

#### 2.4 What data does each instance consist of? 'Raw' data (e.g. unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description. 

Each instance contains a 'number of trends' page, which provides data such as the trends in average asking price and outbid percentage. The page also covers figures such as histograms that show price trends and a pie chart that shows the average age distribution in the province or municipality.

#### 2.5 Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description. 

...

#### 2.6 Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g. redacted text. 

...

#### 2.7 Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., user's movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit. 

Yes, the municipalities are related to eachother by the province they are in. This is made explicit by the dataset by municipalities having the same value in the 'Province' column. 

#### 2.8 Are there recommended data splits (e.g. training,development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaning the rationale behind them. 

...

#### 2.9 Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g. websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources: 
#### a) are there guarantees that they will exist and remain constant over time; 

Huizenzoeker.nl makes every effort to ensure that this website functions properly and to keep it permanently accessible. However, legally the site can not guarantee that the website is accessible or functions properly at all times. Huizenzoeker.nl edits the information offered on its site with the greatest possible care and devotes the same care to the composition of the site. However, it legally cannot guarantee the correctness and completeness of the data shown as a result of imperfections that may occur. 

#### b) are there official arhival versions of the complete datasets (i.e. including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created.
Not sure... I don't think so... 

#### c) are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.

The external resources include [JAAP.nl](https://www.jaap.nl/) and [Huislijn.nl](https://www.huislijn.nl/), which also extract data from other sites such as [Funda.nl](https://www.funda.nl/). These sites are all available for free, so there are not any restrictions in the form of licenses and fees for future users. There is a premium part of Huizenzoeker.nl for which you do need to pay to access it, but we did not use the data on that part of the platform. 

#### 2.10 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g. data that is protected by legal priviledge or by doctorpatient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description. 
No the data is not confidential as this information should be publically available. Therefore users do not have any rights to remove listings from the Huizenzoeker site, only if their house is no longer for sale/rent on JAAP.nl the listing will be removed. However, information about the house itself such as its value, year of construction, property size, will remain available and this is seen as public information that can not be removed. 

#### 2.11 Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why. 
No the data is not in any way offensive, insulting, or threatening. 

#### 2.12 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 

Not applicable. 

#### 2.13 Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset. 

Not applicable (only if we're able to scrape the detailed population data per municipality of a province). 

##### 2.14 Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how. 

Not applicable. 

#### 2.15 Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g. data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description. 

Not applicable. 

### 3 Collection process 

(I think it's a bit vague whether these questions are all about how we collected the data from the site, or how the site collected their data?)

#### 3.1 How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.

Most of the data collected was directly observable from the huizenzoeker.nl/woningmarkt/ part of the platform. The 'woningmarkt' function shows for every municipality and province the average price, number of houses sold, average price per squared metre, percentage outbid, disposable income per household etc. 

#### 3.2 What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)? How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?

We scraped the data using Python's programming software in Jupyter Notebooks, using different packages such as BeautifulSoup and Selenium. 

#### 3.3 If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?

...

#### 3.4 Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

...

#### 3.5 Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the time- frame in which the data associated with the instances was created.

...

#### 3.6 Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)? If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

...

#### 3.7 Does the dataset relate to people? If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section.

Not applicable. 

#### 3.8 Did you collect the data from the individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g., websites)?

Not applicable. 

#### 3.9 Were the individuals in question notified about the data collection? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how notice was provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or other- wise reproduce, the exact language of the notification itself.

Not applicable. 

#### 3.10 Did the individuals in question consent to the collection and use of their data? If so, please describe (or show with screenshots or other information) how consent was requested and provided, and provide a link or other access point to, or otherwise reproduce, the exact language to which the individuals consented.

Not applicable. 

#### 3.11 If consent was obtained, were the consenting individuals provided with a mechanism to revoke their consent in the future or for certain uses? If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).

Not applicable. 

#### 3.12 Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact analysis) been conducted? If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.

Not appliable. 

### 4 Preprocessing, cleaning, labeling 

#### 4.1 Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remain- der of the questions in this section. 

...

#### 4.2 Was the ârawâ data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? If so, please provide a link or other access point to the ârawâ data.

I do not this was possible for our project as the data on the site is updated every month. 

#### 4.3 Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available? If so, please provide a link or other access point.

Python? Rstudio? 

### 5 Uses

#### 5.1 Has the dataset been used for any tasks already? If so, please provide a description. 

We used our dataset in RStudio to create some plots and figures of the data we collected; to give insights into how we would compare the municipalities for each province, and the data between the provinces. 

#### 5.2 Is there a repository that links to any or all papers or systems that use the dataset? If so, please provide a link or other access point.

This repository? 

#### 5.3 What (other) tasks could the dataset be used for?

Helping users find the best municipality for them to live in (where they will have the highest chance of succeeding to find a house), to help them in negotiations on the price, and to help them find out what is the norm in terms of overbidding for each municipality. 

#### 5.4 Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a future user might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other undesirable harms (e.g., financial harms, legal risks) If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a future user could do to mitigate these undesirable harms?

...

#### 5.5 Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
