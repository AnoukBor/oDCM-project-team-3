# Scraping Huizenzoeker.nl to analyse the Dutch Housing Market

__Which places in the Netherlands are hit hardest by the Dutch Housing crisis, and which the least?__

## Motivation

The housing crisis is one of the most prominent societal challenges in the Netherlands momentarily. Being both very competitive and inaccessible, housing prices continue to rise at astonishing rates as supply is very limited, with many prospective buyers having to overbid in order to ensure the success of their purchase. Therefore, all these factors combined make it very challenging for, especially first-time buyer and young professionals (only 3% of housing is financially accessible to them), to get their foot onto the property ladder. Our aim is to facilitate these groups in terms of their search for buying or renting a house, by establishing a dataset which allows us to clarify which places in the Netherlands are hit hardest by the Dutch housing crisis (where you wouldn’t want to buy or rent a house at the moment) and 
which the least. We plan to establish such dataset by scraping Huizenzoeker.nl which contains much information about the Dutch housing market, including many statistics about 
the housing prices and how these fluctuate and have developed in different areas over the last years and months.
